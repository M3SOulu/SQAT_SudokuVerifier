public class SudokuVerifier {
	
	I give up for this exercise for today. For me it needs
	lots more time to actually figure out the way arrays
	work in Java that is possible to achieve today.
	
	public int verify(String candidateSolution) {
		
		String sudokuString = candidateSolution;
		
		String sudokuArray[]= sudokuString.split("");
		
		
		
		
		// returns 0 if the candidate solution is correct
		return 0;
		
		//check
	}
}
